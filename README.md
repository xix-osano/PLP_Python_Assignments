# Week One Assignment 
## **Instructions:**

### *Basic Calculator Program*

* Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
* Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
* Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.

# Week Two Assignment
## **Description** 

* 1. Create an empty list called my_list.
* 2. Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.
* 3. Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.
* 4. Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
* 5. Remove the last element from my_list.
* 6. Sort my_list in ascending order.
* 7. Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.

# Week Three Assignment
## **Objectives**

* 1. Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
* 2. Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

# Week Four Assignment
## **Objectives**

* File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
* Error Handling Lab 🧪: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn’t exist or can’t be read.

# Week Five Assignment
## **Objectives**

### *Actiivity One: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️*
* Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
* Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
* Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
* Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.
  
### *Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭*

* Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
